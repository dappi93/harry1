    <h2>Chamber of Secrets (1998)</h2>
    <p>The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
      <br>during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn
      <br>that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families.
      <br>These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified.
      <br>Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.</p>
